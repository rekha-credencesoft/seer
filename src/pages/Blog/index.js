              Consider a retailer with 20,000 SKUs and 50 stores (potentially 1
              million store / SKU combinations) and the latter’s implications
              for the inventory planner. The sheer volume of data is mind
              boggling. Every stage of the stock life cycle, from building the
              range to end of line sell through, calls for a level of detail in
              execution that is constrained by available resource and the
              capacity of the human mind to process the myriad of data points
              simultaneously. Invariably, the planner compromises. They may
              apply approximations such as calculating at aggregate and
              extrapolating across individual SKUs, rely on intuition or focus
              on the top performing lines at the expense of the others. The
              outcome is stock imbalances leading to costly inter-store stock
              movements, markdowns and lost sales.

              Enter AI with its potential to alleviate all the above. When we
              speak of AI, we mean deep learning. But what is deep learning? How
              does it work? And how can you apply it in your business?

              Deep learning replicates the human mind’s ability to perceive
              underlying, often subtle patterns in data. Consider predicting the
              age of a person standing in front of you. Your eyes absorb
              millions of bits of information, and your brain easily maps them
              to a notion of age based on a lifetime of experience or
              “training”. Now imagine if you could just as easily predict sales
              for all your SKUs across all stores by simply glancing at millions
              of rows sales history. This is the mind enhancing power of deep
              learning. Like the brain, deep learning algorithms learn from
              historical examples, but they aren’t overwhelmed by large volumes
              of numerical data. In fact, they require it.

              Knowing what will sell, where and when underpins all stock

              An AI implementation entails identifying a problem typically a
              labour intensive or inaccurate process. Pertinent data is
              replicated to a secure cloud using APIs, the algorithm is trained,
              and predictions are made which are autonomously applied to address
              the problem. The process can then be repeated.
