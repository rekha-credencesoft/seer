                        Glassons are renowned for quality fashion, winning value, and vibrant stores.
                        Their mission is to deliver exactly what their customers want when they want it;
                        and pride themselves as a destination for what’s new, what’s trending, must-have fashion pieces,
                        wardrobe staples and everything in between! Glassons epitomises “fast fashion”.
                        Most styles sell out within days or weeks of hitting stores.
                        New lines appear each day and customers know if they don’t buy a desired item today, they will likely miss out tomorrow.
                        With 25% of sales transacted on-line however, and a proportion returned or exchanged in store, a typical week can see up to 100 already sold-out items returned to each store.

                To avoid polluting the store with out-of-stock items, the store racks the returns in the stock room and advises head office of the items and quantities. Head office manually reviews returns across all stores,
                runs reports to identify stock and sales by store, and applies operational rules to determine where each store should send its returns.
                The process is time consuming and error prone, resulting in many thousands of items
                languishing on racks in stock rooms or transferred to sub-optimal locations.
                Glassons chose Seer to automate and improve outcomes for this manual process. Each Sunday the store scans returns for the week. Using Seer’s API, the returns are uploaded to the Seer cloud and
                analysed by our AI algorithms to determine the optimum selling stores. An autonomous process then applies Glassons’ rules to propose movements.
                The result is dramatically reduced effort at store and head office, items spending less time out of circulation, and optimal movements across stores that maximise sell through.

                        Operational complexities at Animates derive from ensuring both the right range of stock and appropriate store stock levels to meet customer expectations and demand. Promotions form a key part of their marketing strategy and when combined with seasonal fluctuations, require merchandisers to spend days a week maintaining re-order points and safety stock to support accurate weekly vendor re-orders.
                        With more than 5,000 products across 50 stores, it is impossible for merchandisers to accurately forecast sales and infer optimum stock levels. The result is under, and over-stocked items and a merchandise team constrained by excessive repetitive tasks, impacting financial performance and customer satisfaction.

We deployed Stock Seer’s AI to generate sales forecasts that accurately account for seasonal fluctuations and forecast promotions. Thereafter, statistical methods were applied to calculate optimum safety stock levels and re-order points based on a nominated service level, and automatically generated optimum purchase orders.
