            A 46-store strong, Australia/New Zealand based chain, Hallensteins
            provides quality clothing that's both stylish and affordable,
            catering to the modern man's evolving tastes. For Hallensteins, a
            compelling in store experience demands an optimum balance between
            stock quantity and space conservation, presenting visual appeal and
            choice without clutter. Their central warehouse is key, replenishing
            stores daily, and enabling the store to carry just the right stock
            to meet anticipated sales up to the next replenishment. However,
            determining the ideal stock levels, week on week, for some 276,000
            product store combinations, is an impossible task for the human
            stock controller. A lack of resource, and the inability of the human
            mind to accurately forecast evolving sales, forces a reliance on
            crude averages that tend to over-allocate to mitigate risk of stock
            outs. The result: cluttered stores and lost sales as the season
            progresses, with faster moving stores selling out while product
            languishes in the quieter store. Costly inter store movements ensue.

            Once again, we deployed Stock Seer to automate this manual process
            generating an accurate, weekly sales forecast with seasonal
            fluctuations and planned promotions accounted for. As with Animates,
            the forecast was used, in conjunction with standard business rules,
            to determine more sensible target stock levels and safety stock
            buffers, with respect to the predicted demand. Thus far, we have
            saved $500,000 thanks to mitigations in out of stocks and overstocks
            via the A.I. driven process.
